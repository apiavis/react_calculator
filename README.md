# React Calculator

## Overview

This project was part of my software development apprenticeship program.  The requirement was to build a functional calculator using React.  I was then required to set up React routes in order to create a single-page app that appears to function like a multi-page app.  For this project, I used HTML CSS, JS, and React.
